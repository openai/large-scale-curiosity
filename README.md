This is a TensorFlow based implementation for our [paper on large-scale study of curiosity-driven learning](https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/) across
54 environments. Curiosity is a type of intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal. In this paper, We perform the first large-scale study of purely curiosity-driven learning, i.e. without any extrinsic rewards, across 54 standard benchmark environments. We further investigate the effect of using different feature spaces for computing prediction error and show that random features are sufficient for many popular RL game benchmarks, but learned features appear to generalize better (e.g. to novel game levels in Super Mario Bros.).

### Installation and Usage

Install dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The following command should train a pure exploration agent on Breakout with default experiment parameters.
```bash
python run.py
```
To use more than one gpu/machine, use MPI (e.g. `mpiexec -n 8 python run.py` should use 1024 parallel environments to collect experience instead of the default 128 on an 8 gpu machine).

### Data for plots in paper

[Data for Figure-2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufr7o8g9omb9zpl/experiments.tar.gz): contains raw game score data along with the plotting code to generate Figure-2 in the paper.
